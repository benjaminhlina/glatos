# Introduction

The `residence_index` function in the R package *glatos* calculates the relative
amount of time that a tagged animal (or animals) occupied each of a set of
discrete locations monitored by receivers. Among locations in a detection
dataset, the derivation of the residency index (RI) value for each location *k*
seems simple at first glance: 
 $$RI_{k} = \frac{t_{k}}{T}\text{,}$$
where $t_{k}$ is the amount of time spent at location *k* and 
$T = \sum_{k=1}^{K}{t_k}$ is the total amount of time spent among any of all 
*K* locations. In practice, there are numerous ways to calculate $t_{k}$ and
thus, seemingly endless flavors of RI exist (much like other ecological
indices). `residence_index` provides five different calculation methods for RI.
Each method has either been previously described in scientific literature (e.g.,
the "Kessel" method[^1]) or represents what we theorize as appropriate methods
for certain situations (array designs, questions, etc.). However, these methods
have only recently been developed and are still being evaluated. With any of the
above methods, use of RI to address specific questions or test hypotheses about
animal space use will further require assumptions and data manipulation. For
example, when a dataset contains detections of multiple tagged animals, it may
be prudent to use the mean RI ($\bar{RI}_k$) among individuals, which requires
calculating RI for each individual separately. Similarly, one might seek to
compare $\bar{RI}_k$ among groups of animals (e.g., by age, sex) or time
periods. Examples in this vignette are intended to briefly introduce methods
that may be useful for such manipulations and also for summarizing and exploring
RI with graphs and maps.

## *residence_index* overview

The *residence_index* function will take a condensed detection event dataframe 
(in the form returned by the *glatos* function *detection_events* with argument
`condensed = TRUE`) and return a data frame with $RI_k$, $t_k$ (in days), and
$t_K$ (in days) for each location in columns named *residency_index*,
*detected_days*, and *total_days*, respectively. Latitude and longitude of each
unique *location* are also summarized and returned in columns named
*mean_latitude* and *mean_longitude*.

### Calculation methods

The `calculation_method` argument is used to specify the method used to
calculate RI and its components. Currently, five methods are avaiable, which 
differ principally by the way they calculate the amount of time detected:

 - **kessel**
 : counts discrete calendar days
 
 - **time_interval**
 : counts discrete time intervals of user-specified size (e.g., 1 day, 2 weeks, 
 etc.); interval size is set by argument `time_interval_size`
 
 - **timediff**
 : calculates total duration between first detection of first event
 and last detection of last event within each location (or group)

 - **aggregate_no_overlap** 
 : calculates total duration among all detection events but does not 
 "double count" any overlapping events
 
 - **aggregate_with_overlap**
 : calculates total duration among all detection events but counts 
 all events separately




### Defining locations

By default, RI calculations and results (which also include mean latitude and 
longitude for each unique location) are limited to the set of locations 
present in the input data frame and will not include locations 
where no animals were detected. To include sites with no detections, a set of 
locations can be specified in a data frame via the `locations` argument. 

### Other grouping variables

RI is always calculated separately for each unique value of in the *location*
column of the input detection data or optional `locations` data frame,
but one or more additional grouping columns can be specified using the
`group_col` argument. By default, `group_col = "animal_id"`, so RI will be
calculated for each animal at each location. If `group_col = NULL`, then the
*animal_id* column (an all other columns except *location*) will be ignored.

### Accounting for groups in total time (*T*)

By default (when argument `groupwise_total = FALSE`), the denominator of the RI
calculation (representing total time detected) will ignore grouping variables
specified in `group_col` such that for group *i* at location *k*
$$RI_{k,i} = \frac{t_{k,i}}{\sum_{k=1}^Kt_k}\text{.}$$ 
For example when `group_col = "animal_id"`, $RI_{k,i}$ for each animal
represents the time that a particular animal *i* spent at location *k* as a
proportion of time that *all animals* spent at all locations. Conversely, if
`groupwise_total = TRUE`, then total time will represent the proportion of time 
that *only the *i*th animal* spent at all locations, such that
$$RI_{k,i} = \frac{t_{k,i}}{\sum_{k=1}^Kt_{k,i}}\text{.}$$

is_html_output = function() {

}

# Calculation methods - simple examples

This section includes simple examples of each of the five calculation methods
using example walleye data and mostly-default input arguments. Results are
displayed as simple bubble plots (maps) in this section, because it is generic
and effective--not because it is our preferred or recommended method. More
capable and user-friendly plotting methods, including the purpose-built
*ri_plot* function, will be briefly introduced in another section, but for the
most part we expect users to use a wide variety of plotting methods depending on
their particular goals and preferences.

## Importing Libraries
Import `glatos`.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(glatos)
```

## Importing and Compressing Data
We will import the sample walleye detection data using 
`glatos::read_glatos_detections()`.

Note that `system.file` is only used here because we need to get the path to the
example data file that's bundled with the *glatos* package. To run a different 
file from another location, skip this function and just set `det_file` to
the path of your own file (e.g., `det_file <-
"C:/your_files/your_detections.csv"`).

```{r, message=FALSE}
det_file <- system.file("extdata", "walleye_detections.csv",
                        package = "glatos")

detections <- read_glatos_detections(det_file)
```

Next, we compress the detections into detection events using 
`glatos::detection_events()` and include the time-based event separator 
(argument `time_sep`) of 3600 seconds (one hour). This means that events will 
not contain a time gap (at the same location) exceeding one hour. Note that the 
other arguments are not shown below because we are using default values, which
means the detection events will be grouped on the *glatos_array* column
(`location_col` argument). Finally, the events are in "condensed" 
(i.e., "compressed") form, meaning there is one row for each event, including 
*first_detection* and *last_detection* timestamps.


```{r}
det_events <- glatos::detection_events(detections, time_sep = "3600")
```
Note the structure below. *residence_index* requires a file with this structure.
```{r}
head(det_events)

```


## Kessel Method

The "Kessel" method (`calculation_method = "kessel"`) is based on the method
described by Kessel et al. (2016)[^1]. It converts both the *first_detection*
and *last_detection* columns into a date with no hours, minutes, or seconds.
Next it creates a list of the unique days where a detection was seen. The size
of the list is returned as the total number of days as an integer. This
calculation is used to determine the total number of distinct days (T) and the
total number of distinct days per location (S). Possible rounding error may
occur as a detection on `2016-01-01 23:59:59` and a detection on `2016-01-02
00:00:01` would be counted as two days when it is really 2-3 seconds.

>$RI = \frac{S}{T}$
>
>$RI = Residence Index$
>
>$S$ = Distinct number of days detected at the location
>
>$T$ = Distinct number of days detected at any location


```{r}
ri <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, calculation_method = 'kessel')
```

Note the resulting structure.
```{r}
head(ri)
```

A boxplot is a quick and simple way to explore variation in RI among locations
when `group_col = "animal_id"`. 

Here we make a vertical boxplot showing distributions of RI among fish at 
each location. Keep in mind that this is a treacherous example because there is 
only three fish in this data set (boxplots of 3 fish aren't very useful). 
Nonetheless, boxplots are a simple and effective way to explore variation 
within and among locations.

```{r}
boxplot(residency_index~location, data = ri, horizontal = TRUE, las = 1, 
        xlab= 'Residence Index (method = "kessel")')
```


Next we will plot RI values on a map. We'll start with a plot for 
each fish on the sample Great Lakes polygon object that is bundled with the 
*glatos* package.

Here's the plot for one fish... 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#get example great lakes polygon
data(greatLakesPoly)

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(ri$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(ri$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
ri <- ri[order(ri$residency_index, decreasing = TRUE),]

#make column for symbol color
ri$color <- "red"
ri$color[ri$residency_index == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = ri[ri$animal_id == "153",], 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*residency_index, bg = color)

```

Notice that this fish was detected at all sites in L. Huron and none in L. Erie
and detections at the two more northern sites accounted for more time than 
other sites.

The second fish shows a much different pattern (below), with detections only 
in the Maumee River and near reefs in the Western Basin.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(ri$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(ri$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = ri[ri$animal_id == "22",], 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*residency_index, bg = color)
```


The third fish shares one site in common (Maumee R.) with the second fish, 
but was otherwise only detected in the Detroit and St. Clair rivers.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(ri$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(ri$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = ri[ri$animal_id == "23",], 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*residency_index, bg = color)

```

Next, we will calculate and plot the mean RI among the three fish (yes, the 
sample size is too small; this is just a demo).

We will use functions from the *dplyr* package and pipes (`%>%`) from *magrittr*
package because that's what the kids are into these days.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
rik_summary <- ri %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

head(rik_summary)

```

Now we plot the means on a map.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(ri$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(ri$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
rik_summary <- rik_summary[order(rik_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#make column for symbol color
rik_summary$color <- "red"
rik_summary$color[rik_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = rik_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```

If we had more than three fish in our sample data set, we might infer something 
about the walleye space use from this information.

### Optional location data

Notice in the last plot that all there were no locations without detections. 
Let's bring in receiver location data from the rest of the GLATOS network.
We will read in the sample receiver file using `glatos::read_glatos_receivers()` 
and then change column names to match those required by `residence_index()`.

```{r}
#get sample receiver data from pkg
loc_file <- system.file("extdata", "sample_receivers.csv", 
                        package = "glatos")
locs <- read_glatos_receivers(loc_file)
locs <- unique(locs[ , c("glatos_array", "deploy_lat", "deploy_long")])
names(locs) <- c("location", "mean_latitude", "mean_longitude")

rik2 <- residence_index(det_events, locations = locs,
                         calculation_method = 'kessel')

```

Now we calculate mean RI and graph again. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
rik2_summary <- rik2 %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
rik2_summary <- rik2_summary[order(rik2_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(rik2$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(rik2$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
rik2_summary$color <- "red"
rik2_summary$color[rik2_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = rik2_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```

### Groupwise total time

Next, let's recalculate RI using `groupwise_total = TRUE` so that RI 
represents the proportion of each fish's own time spent at each location.

```{r}
rik3 <- residence_index(det_events, locations = locs,
                        calculation_method = 'kessel',
                        groupwise_total = TRUE  )

```

Now we calculate mean RI and graph again. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
rik3_summary <- rik3 %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
rik3_summary <- rik3_summary[order(rik3_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(rik3$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(rik3$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
rik3_summary$color <- "red"
rik3_summary$color[rik3_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = rik3_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```

Results here are different than the previous example, with noticably larger
mean RI values in Lake Erie and the Maumee River when total time represents 
individual fish instead of all fish.

## Time Interval Method

The "time interval" method (`calculation_method = "time_interval"`) is similar
to the "kessel" method, but allows the user to specify size of the time
interval. Specifically, this method determines the number of time intervals in
which detections occurred at each location and as a fraction of the number of
time intervals in which detections occurred among all sites. For each location,
residency index (RI) is calculated:

>$RI = \frac{L}{T}$
>
>$RI = Residence Index$
>
>$L$ = Distinct number of time intervals in which detection observed at this location
>
>$T$ = Distinct number of time intervals in which detection observed at any location

For consistency with other calculation_methods, the L and T are not reported, but are converted cumulative time covered in days and reported in columns days_detected and total_days.


```{r}
riti <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, locations = locs, 
                                calculation_method = "time_interval")
```

Note the resulting structure.
```{r}
head(riti)
```


Now we calculate mean RI and graph again. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
riti_summary <- riti %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
riti_summary <- riti_summary[order(riti_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(riti$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(riti$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
riti_summary$color <- "red"
riti_summary$color[riti_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = riti_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```

This is very similar to the "kessel" results, as expected.

### Changing time interval size

Next, let's recalculate RI using finer (15 min) and coarser (monthly) time 
intervals.

#### 15-minute intervals

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
riti <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, locations = locs, 
                                calculation_method = "time_interval",
                                time_interval_size = "15 mins")

#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
riti_summary <- riti %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
riti_summary <- riti_summary[order(riti_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(riti$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(riti$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
riti_summary$color <- "red"
riti_summary$color[riti_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = riti_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```

#### monthly intervals

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
riti <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, locations = locs, 
                                calculation_method = "time_interval",
                                time_interval_size = "1 month")

#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
riti_summary <- riti %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
riti_summary <- riti_summary[order(riti_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(riti$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(riti$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
riti_summary$color <- "red"
riti_summary$color[riti_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = riti_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)

```



\pagebreak


## Timedelta Method

The "Timedelta" method (method (`calculation_method = "timedelta"`) calculates
the time difference between the first *first_detection* among all detection
events and the last *last_detection* among all detection events. The timedelta
for each location is divided by the timedelta among all locations to determine
the residence index.

>$RI = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta T}$
>
>$RI$ = Residence Index
>
>$\Delta S$ = Last detection time at the location - First detection time at the location
>
>$\Delta T$ = Last detection time at any location - First detection time at any location  
  
  
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ritd <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, locations = locs, 
                                calculation_method = "timedelta")

#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
ritd_summary <- ritd %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
ritd_summary <- ritd_summary[order(ritd_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(ritd$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(ritd$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
ritd_summary$color <- "red"
ritd_summary$color[ritd_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = ritd_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)
```

The relatively large points in Saginaw Bay reflect that the total time spanned 
(not necessarily occupied or detected) at those sites was proportionally larger 
than others. In other words, fish tended to revisit those sites over long 
time periods. Keep in mind however, that this could be influenced by other 
variables, such as the amount of time a fish was at large and alive.

\pagebreak

## Aggregate With Overlap Method

The "Aggregate With Overlap" method (`calculation_method =
"aggregate_with_overlap"`) takes the length of time of each detection event and
sums them together. A total is returned. The sum for each location is then
divided by the sum among all locations to determine the residence index. 

Overlapping events at a given location will only exist in detection event 
data if multiple animals are represented and therefore is only applicable 
when `group_col = NA`.

>$RI = \frac{AwOS}{AwOT}$
>
>$RI$ = Residence Index
>
>$AwOS$ = Sum of length of time of each detection at the location
>
>$AwOT$ = Sum of length of time of each detection among all locations  
  
Note that we set `group_col = NA` for this method.
  
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

## Aggregate No Overlap Method

The "Aggregate No Overlap" method (`calculation_method =
"aggregate_no_overlap"`) takes the length of time of each detection event and sums
them together. However, any overlap in time between one or more detection events is
excluded from the sum. For example, if the first detection event spans from `2016-01-01
01:02:43` to `2016-01-01 01:10:12` and the second detection event spans from `2016-01-01
01:09:01` to `2016-01-01 01:12:43`, then the sum of those two events would
be 10 minutes. A total is returned once all events have been added without
overlap. The sum for each station is then divided by the sum of the array to
determine the residence index.

Overlapping events at a given location will only exist in detection event 
data if multiple animals are represented and therefore is only applicable 
when `group_col = NA`.


>$RI = \frac{AnOS}{AnOT}$
>
>$RI$ = Residence Index
>
>$AnOS$ = Sum of length of time of each location, excluding any overlap
>
>$AnOT$ = Sum of length of time among all locations, excluding any overlap

Note that we set `group_col = NA` for this method.
  
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
riano <- glatos::residence_index(det_events, locations = locs, 
                                calculation_method = "aggregate_with_overlap",
                                group_col = NA)

#calculate mean and sd of RI among fish
riano_summary <- riano %>% 
               group_by(location, mean_latitude, mean_longitude) %>% 
               summarise(
                    ri_mean = mean(residency_index),
                    ri_sd = sd(residency_index))

#sort by decreasing residency_index so that large bubbles don't hide smaller
riano_summary <- riano_summary[order(riano_summary$ri_mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

#plot; note indexing sp for plot.sp
sp::plot(greatLakesPoly, asp = 1, 
           xlim = range(riano$mean_longitude),
           ylim = range(riano$mean_latitude),  
           col = "white", bg = "grey80")

#make column for symbol color
riano_summary$color <- "red"
riano_summary$color[riano_summary$ri_mean == 0] <- "pink" #sites with no detects

points(mean_latitude ~ mean_longitude, data = riano_summary, 
  pch = 21, cex = 1 + 30*ri_mean, bg = color)
``` 

In this particular data set, there are no overlapping detection events 
(among fish). Otherwise, these points would appear smaller than the previous 
example.

# Plotting with Plotly

Below is the code for plotting the RI using `plotly`. `plotly` allows us to 
interact with the map rather than haveing a static image. More about `plotly`
can be found [here](https://plot.ly/r/). To export figures as image files from 
`plotly` you will also need the external command line program `orca`. To 
install `orca`, see https://github.com/plotly/orca#installation.  

Attach the `plotly` library.  

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Sys.setenv('MAPBOX_TOKEN' = 'Your Token Here')
```


Set up the map.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,  fig.keep="FALSE"}
geo <- list(
    scope = 'north america',
  showland = TRUE,
  landcolor = toRGB("white"),
  showocean = TRUE,
  oceancolor = toRGB("gray"),
  showcountries = TRUE,
  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = plotly::toRGB("gray"),
  
  resolution = 50,
  center = list(lat = median(ri$mean_latitude),
                lon = median(ri$mean_longitude)),
  lonaxis = list(range=c(min(ri$mean_longitude)-1, max(ri$mean_longitude)+1)),
  lataxis = list(range=c(min(ri$mean_latitude)-1, max(ri$mean_latitude)+1))
)


map <- ri %>% 
  plot_geo(lat = ~mean_latitude, lon = ~mean_longitude, color = ~residency_index )%>%
  add_markers(
            text = ~paste(location, ': ', residency_index),
            hoverinfo = "text",
    size = ~c(residency_index * 5)
  )%>%
  layout(title = "Kessel RI",geo = geo)
```

To show the map you can just type out the variable name.
```{r, eval=is_html_output(), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
map
```

Exporting the map as an image file requires the external program `orca`, which
is called by `plotly::orca()`.

```{r, eval=!is_html_output() ,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
orca(map, file = 'kessel.png')
knitr::include_graphics('kessel.png')
```
