\title{Classify discrete events in detection data}
\usage{
detection_events(detections, location_variable = "glatos_array",
  time_sep = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{detections}{A data frame containing detection data with at least 
  four columns named 'animal_id', 'detection_timestamp_utc', 'deploy_lat', 
  and 'deploy_long' plus a location column for grouping, which is specified
  using \code{location_variable}.
  
  \code{detections}: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{animal_id} is a character string with the name of the column 
         containing the individual animal identifier.
 \item \code{detection_timestamp_utc} is a character string with the name 
   of the column containing datetime stamps for the detections (MUST be of 
   class 'POSIXct').
 \item \code{deploy_lat} is a character string with the name of the column
    containing latitude of the receiver in decimal degrees (NAD83).
 \item \code{deploy_long} is a character string with the name of the column
    containing longitude of the receiver in decimal degrees (NAD83).
}}

\item{location_variable}{A character string indicating the column name in the
detections data frame that will be used as the location grouping variable
(e.g. "glatos_array", "station")}

\item{time_sep}{Amount of time (in seconds) that must pass between 
sequential detections on the same receiver (or group of receivers, 
depending on specified location) before that detection is considered to 
belong to a new detection event. The default value \code{Inf}, will not 
define events based on elapsed time (only when location changes).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing discrete detection event data:
\item{mean_latitude}{Mean latitude of detections comprising each event.}
	\item{mean_longitude}{Mean longitude of detections comprising each event.}
 \item{first_detection}{The time of the first detection in a given detection 
   event.} 
 \item{last_detection}{The time of the last detection in a given detection 
   event.}  
 \item{num_detections}{The total number of detection that comprised a given
	  detection event.}
 \item{res_time_sec}{The elapsed time in seconds between the first and last 
	detection in a given event.}
}
\description{
Reduce detection data from an acoustic telemetry receiver into discrete 
  detection events, defined by movement between receivers (or receiver 
  groups, depending on location), or sequential detections at the same 
  location that are separated by a user-defined threshold period of time.
}
\details{
mean_latitude and mean_longitude columns in the output dataframe are 
  the mean GPS locations for the detections comprising that detection event. 
  For example, if the a fish was detected at 3 receiver stations in a 
  glatos_array and glatos_array was selected as the location, then GPS 
  location for that event will be the mean of the latitude and longitude 
  for those three receiver stations (weighted based on the number of 
  detections that occurred on each station).

\examples{

#get path to example detection file
det_file <- system.file("extdata", 
  "walleye_detections.zip", package = "glatos")
det_file <- unzip(det_file, "walleye_detections.csv")
walleye_detections <- read_glatos_detections(det_file)

filt0 <- detection_events(walleye_detections) #no time filter

#7-day filter
filt_7d <- detection_events(walleye_detections , time_sep = 604800)
